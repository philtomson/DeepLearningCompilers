# Deep Learning Compilers/Optimizers

List of high-performance, deep-learning-oriented IRs/compilers/Optimizers in no particular order:

* XLA (Google): https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/xla/

* taco (MIT): http://tensor-compiler.org/

* DLVM (UIUC): http://dlvm.org/ (No Longer maintained)

* Swift for Tensorflow (Google): https://github.com/tensorflow/swift 
  (DLVM maintainers moved on to this project)

* nGraph (Intel): http://ngraph.nervanasys.com/docs/cpp/

* TVM (DMLC): https://github.com/dmlc/tvm

* Julia's Flux/DataFlow: https://github.com/MikeInnes/DataFlow.jl https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl
  (Flux is a ML framework that uses DataFlow.jl - not a lot of optimization happening yet, but has potential)
  
* Glow (PyTorch/FaceBook):  https://github.com/pytorch/glow
